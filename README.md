# Indeed Job Postings Analysis
This assignment focuses on scraping job posting information from Indeed in order to analyze their contents. I used BeautifulSoup and Requests for data collection and then I analyzed the contents using the NLTK package. The full results can be found [here](https://github.com/colingreen18/job_posting_analysis/blob/main/indeed_scraping/Indeed%20Scraping.pdf)
