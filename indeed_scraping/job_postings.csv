How to apply:</p><p>
For students, we are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about to properly assess your potential. Instead we want to get to know YOU and hear about the experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but for students applying to one of our co-ops, internships or TILT new grad programs we are no longer requiring resumes. Instead we ask that as part of your application, you complete the below:</p><p>
1. Complete your PLUM Profile: https://bit.ly/2UvR3Sm</p><p>
2. Complete a short one-way video interview: https://ca.rivs.com/i/ScotiabankGBM2020/</p><p>
3. Apply to the role through our career site! When the application asks for your resume, instead upload a screenshot of your plum to show us you’ve completed it, we have full access to your entire profile from Plum and won’t use the screenshot but it’s a great reminder for each of you to have completed it. Alternatively you can submit a resume if you want, we just will not be relying on it when we assess you.</p><p><br/>
Candidates are invited to submit their Plum profile in a single PDF to the resume section ONLY. For video interviews students only need to complete the GBM Support Functions video interview once. The link to the video interview is labelled GBM2020. Any link with this label means only have to complete this video once.</p></div></div><br/>
